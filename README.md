# Stroke Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a stroke prediction project. The goal of the project is to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on a dataset with 12 attributes and 5110 rows.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project contains 12 attributes and 5110 rows.
- Link to Dataset:  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset?resource=download">Stroke Prediction Data set</a>

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
  - `1_data_exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring the dataset.
  - `2_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for preprocessing the data.
  - `3_model_training.ipynb`: Notebook for training the Na√Øve Bayes model.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for modular code components.
- `requirements.txt`: File specifying project dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
